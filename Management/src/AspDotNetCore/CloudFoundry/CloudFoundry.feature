    Scenario: CloudFoundry Management for .Net Core 2.1 (win10-x64)
        Given you have at least .Net Core SDK 2.1.300 installed
        And you have CloudFoundry service p.mysql installed
        When you run: cf create-service p.mysql db-small myMySqlService
        And you wait until CloudFoundry service myMySqlService is created
        And you run: dotnet restore
        And you run: dotnet publish -f netcoreapp2.1 -r win10-x64
        And you run in the background: cf push -f manifest-windows.yml -p bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/win10-x64/publish
