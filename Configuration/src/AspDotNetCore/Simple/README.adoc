:sccs: Spring Cloud Config Server

ASP.NET Core sample app illustrating how to use https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/[{sccs}] as a configuration source.

== Prepare

.Clone this repo
----
$ git clone https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples
$ cd samples/Configuration/src/AspDotNetCore/Simple
----

== Run {sccs}

The default configuration of {sccs} uses https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo for its source of configuration data.

Start {sccs} using one of the following:

=== Docker

----
$ docker-compose up
----

=== Build From Source

Building from source requires Java 8 JDK and Maven 3.x.

.Build/Run {sccs} from GitHub repository
----
$ git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config
$ cd spring-cloud-config\spring-cloud-config-server
$ git checkout v1.3.3.RELEASE
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----

== Run Sample

----
$ dotnet restore
$ dotnet run -f netcoreapp2.1   # alternatively, dotnet run -f net461
----

== What to Expect

After building and running the app, you should see something like the following:

----
$ dotnet run -f netcoreapp2.1
Using launch settings from ...
Hosting environment: development
Content root path: ....
Now listening on: http://localhost:5000
Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
----

Fire up a browser and open http://localhost:5000.  Once on the home page, navigate to http://localhost:5000/Home/ConfigServer and you'll see the values stored in the github repository used for the Spring Cloud Config Server samples.

If you navigate to the http://localhost:5000/Home/ConfigServerSettings, you will see the settings used by the Spring Cloud Config server client.

Change the Hosting environment setting to `development` (i.e., set `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=development`), then restart the application. You will see different configuration data returned for that profile/hosting environment.

[NOTE]
_See the Official https://steeltoe.io/docs/steeltoe-configuration[Steeltoe Configuration Documentation] for a more in-depth walkthrough of the samples and more detailed information._
